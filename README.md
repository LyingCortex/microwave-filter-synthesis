# microwave-filter-synthesis

A Python library for microwave filter synthesis based on coupling matrix methods.

This package focuses on:
- Generalized Chebyshev filter approximation
- Coupling matrix synthesis (Cameron / Amari methods)
- Topology transformations (folded, arrow, wheel)
- Frequency-domain response evaluation

The library is designed for **research, education, and engineering prototyping**.
